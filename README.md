# Park It

## About this project

Park It is the parking lot sharing app for everyone with a car and everyone with a spot. Users of this app can book parking spaces for short term rental or list their own spaces for rent. Park It was planned and built in just under two weeks by Penny Clark and Noah MJ Jung as their final project for the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp.

## Dependencies

Front end: Material-UI, React Router Dom, Leaflet, Axios
Back end: Pg, Dotenv, Knex

## Running the project

To start this project, `npm install` the dependencies in both the front end and the back end directories and run `npm start` in each directory from two separate terminals. We used a Postgres database for data persistance and Knex to manage our migrations.
