# Part It

## About this project

Park It is the parking lot sharing app for everyone with a car and everyone with a spot. Users of this app can book parking spaces for short term rental or list their own spaces for rent. Park It was built in just over a week by Penny Clark and Noah Jung as their final project for the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp.

## Dependencies

Front end: Material-UI, React Router Dom, Leaflet, Axios
Back end: Pg, Dotenv, Knex

## Running the project

To start this project, `npm install` the dependencies in both the front end and the back end directories and run `npm start` in each directory from two separate terminals. We used a Postgres database for data persistance and Knex to manage our migrations.  

## Note

This project was scaffolded by Garrett's [React + Express No-Fluff Boilerplate](https://github.com/garrettgsb/react-express-boilerplate). Be sure to check it out if you want to build a similar project, and thanks very much Garrett!
